# WebSocket Implementation Notes - Branch: feature/websocket-status-updates

## Overview
This branch implements WebSocket support for real-time status updates, starting with SSH service restart functionality. The implementation uses Socket.IO for bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend.

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Schema Updates (`backend/src/database.ts`)
- Added new `active_operations` table to track ongoing operations:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE active_operations (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    connection_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    operation_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    started_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at DATETIME,
    progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    message TEXT,
    error TEXT,
    metadata TEXT,
    created_by TEXT DEFAULT 'user'
  )
  ```
- Added indexes for performance on `connection_id`, `status`, and `operation_type`
- Added methods for managing active operations (save, update, get, delete)

#### 2. WebSocket Server Setup (`backend/src/websocket-server.ts`)
- Created Socket.IO server with CORS configuration
- Implemented room-based subscriptions (each connection has its own room)
- Added connection/disconnection handling
- Supports subscribing/unsubscribing to specific connections
- Includes heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive

#### 3. Operation Status Manager (`backend/src/services/operation-status-manager.ts`)
- Centralized service for managing all active operations
- Prevents duplicate operations (checks before starting new ones)
- Emits WebSocket events on status changes
- Manages in-memory cache with database persistence
- Automatically cleans up completed operations after 5 minutes

#### 4. Updated Service Restart Endpoint (`backend/src/server.ts`)
- Modified `POST /api/data/:id/restart-service` to use async operations
- Returns immediately with operation ID instead of waiting for completion
- Performs restart in background with real-time progress updates:
  - 10% - Testing SSH connection
  - 30% - SSH connection successful
  - 50% - Executing restart command
  - 90% - Processing results
  - 100% - Complete or failed
- Prevents duplicate restarts by checking for active operations

#### 5. Dependencies Added
- `socket.io`: ^4.8.1
- `@types/socket.io`: ^3.0.1

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. WebSocket Context (`frontend/src/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx`)
- React context for managing WebSocket connection
- Handles automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Manages operation state across components
- Provides hooks for subscribing to connection updates
- Fixed subscription loop issue with proper memoization

#### 2. Service Restart Button Component (`frontend/src/components/ServiceRestartButton.jsx`)
- New component with real-time status display
- Shows progress percentage during restart
- Handles all restart states:
  - Idle: "Restart Service"
  - Starting: "Starting..."
  - In Progress: "Restarting... (X%)" with actual progress
  - Completed: Shows success toast
  - Failed: Shows error toast
- Prevents duplicate restart attempts

#### 3. Updated Home Page (`frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`)
- Replaced inline restart button with `ServiceRestartButton` component
- Removed old `handleServiceRestart` function
- Updated confirmation dialog to use new async restart approach
- Maintains existing UI/UX with enhanced real-time feedback

#### 4. App.jsx Updates
- Added `WebSocketProvider` wrapper around entire app
- Ensures WebSocket connection is available to all components

#### 5. Dependencies Added
- `socket.io-client`: ^4.8.1

### Configuration Changes

#### 1. Server Initialization
- HTTP server wrapped to support WebSocket upgrade
- WebSocket server initialized alongside Express
- Operation manager connected to WebSocket server

#### 2. CORS Configuration
- Updated to support WebSocket connections
- Allows both polling and WebSocket transports

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Real-time Updates**: Users see live progress during service restarts
2. **Prevents Duplicates**: Can't start multiple restarts for same connection
3. **Persistent State**: Refresh page and still see ongoing operations
4. **Cross-Session Sync**: Multiple tabs show same status
5. **Better UX**: Detailed progress messages instead of generic "Restarting..."
6. **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on network issues

## Testing Notes

### To Test the Implementation:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to a VOS connection with SSH enabled
3. Click "Restart Service" button
4. Observe real-time progress updates
5. Try refreshing during restart - progress should persist
6. Open multiple tabs - all should show same status

### Known Issues Fixed:
- Fixed rapid subscribe/unsubscribe loop by memoizing functions
- Added duplicate subscription prevention
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Future Enhancements

This architecture is ready to support:
1. **SSH Test Operations**: Add `ssh_test` operation type
2. **Certificate Renewal**: Convert to use operation manager
3. **Batch Operations**: Track multiple operations simultaneously
4. **Operation History**: Show recent completed operations
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Global view of all active operations

## Docker/Production Considerations

For production deployment, need to:
1. Update nginx.conf for WebSocket proxy support
2. Ensure WebSocket port (3000) is exposed in Docker
3. Configure proper WebSocket path in reverse proxy
4. Consider Redis adapter for multi-instance scaling

## Rollback Instructions

If needed to rollback:
1. Checkout previous branch
2. Remove socket.io dependencies from package.json
3. Drop `active_operations` table from database
4. Restart services

## Key Files Modified

### Backend:
- `/backend/src/server.ts` - Added WebSocket init and updated restart endpoint
- `/backend/src/database.ts` - Added active operations table and methods
- `/backend/src/websocket-server.ts` - New WebSocket server setup
- `/backend/src/services/operation-status-manager.ts` - New operation manager

### Frontend:

## Notes for Tomorrow's Testing

1. Check browser console for WebSocket connection status
2. Monitor backend logs for operation lifecycle
3. Test with slow/failed SSH connections
4. Verify cleanup of old operations
5. Test across different browsers
6. Check memory usage with multiple operations
